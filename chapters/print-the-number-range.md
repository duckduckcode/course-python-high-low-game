# 2. Print the number range

Goal: Tell the player the number range they should guess between


## Steps to print the number range

- Add a **comment** explaining the purpose of the code.
- Use the **print function** to tell the player the number range.
- You may customise the message if you like.

**Reading code examples**
When **new code** is shown, the **code you already have is also shown**, so that you can easily find where to add it in:

The **black text** code block is code you already have.
The **coloured text** code block is new code that you need to add.

## Example code

Add the **coloured text** code block below into your own script:

```
print("High Low Game")
```

```
# tell the user the range of numbers to guess from
print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100")
```

**Run your code**
You should see the output "I'm thinking of a number..."

## Explanation

We just used the "print" method. In Python, displaying text on the screen is known as "printing".

You can spot a method in Python because it has:

- a name: "print"
- followed by a pair of round brackets: "( )"
- with a value between the brackets: "Bananas!"

The "print" method can take some text and display it on the screen.

When we want to use text content in our scripts, we put the text between quote marks " " which helps Python understand that the word or sentence is text content, not code.

The method called "print" is built in to Python. You can also write your own methods, which you will be learning about very soon!
