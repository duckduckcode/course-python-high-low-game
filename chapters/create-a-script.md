# Create a script

Goal: Create a new script for the game code

## Steps to create a script

- Create a new **script** named `high_low.py` using your editor of choice.
- Use the **print function** to test that your script is running correctly.
- Run the script and check the **output**.

```
print("High Low Game")
```

**Run your script**
You should see the output "High Low Game" in your console.

## Explanation

A "Python Script" is a file where you write your Python code.

Python scripts end with the file type `.py`

Python scripts also have a name, like `my_script`

Some examples of Python script file names might be:

- `main.py`
- `my_script.py`
- `cool_game.py`
- `calculator.py`

Python filenames are **all lowercase**
They use **underscores instead of spaces**
They always **end with .py**
